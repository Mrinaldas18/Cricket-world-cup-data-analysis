🏏 T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analytics Project
This project is a complete end-to-end sports data analytics case study focused on the ICC T20 World Cup 2022. It combines data engineering, statistical analysis, and business intelligence to deliver deep insights into team and player performances. The project walks through every phase of a real-world analytics workflow—from data scraping to final visualization—making it an ideal showcase for data analysts, data scientists, and BI developers.

📌 Problem Statement
Cricket generates vast amounts of data, especially during major tournaments like the T20 World Cup. However, extracting actionable insights from such raw data can be challenging. The goal of this project is to build a data-driven model to:

Scrape and clean live match data.

Analyze batting and bowling performance.

Visualize key metrics through interactive dashboards.

Select a "Best XI" team from Earth that could theoretically challenge any opponent—even aliens.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
Bright Data – Web Scraper IDE for extracting data from ESPN Cricinfo.

Python (Pandas) – For cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming JSON into CSV.

Power Query – For further data transformation within Power BI.

Power BI – For dashboard creation and data visualization.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For modeling relationships and KPIs.

ESPN Cricinfo – Source of structured and unstructured cricket data.

📊 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Requirement Scoping
Define key questions: top performers, best strike rates, ideal bowling attack, etc.

Understand data requirements and expected output (dashboard + insights).

2️⃣ Web Scraping
Used Bright Data to build collectors for match scorecards and player stats.

Extracted data such as batting summaries, team stats, and match results.

3️⃣ Data Transformation (Python)
Converted raw JSON data into structured CSV.

Used Pandas to clean, normalize, and reshape data tables (fact & dimension format).

4️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
Imported CSV files into Power BI.

Applied Power Query to build calculated columns (e.g., match stages).

Built relationships between tables (batting, matches, teams).

Created DAX measures: total runs, average, strike rate, wickets, economy, etc.

Designed an interactive and visually rich dashboard.

5️⃣ Insight Generation
Identified top performers by filters: team, stage, opposition, venue, etc.

Selected the Best XI based on statistical performance (e.g., Jos Buttler, Rilee Rossouw, Marcus Stoinis).

Balanced team with openers, power hitters, all-rounders, and bowlers.
